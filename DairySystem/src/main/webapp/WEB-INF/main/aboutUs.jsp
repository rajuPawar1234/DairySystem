A plant nursery is designed for the propagation and care of young plants. Often, it contains one or more large greenhouses, which helps shelter new plants from frosts or excessive heat. It may also include complex watering systems to cut down on the labor of workers. Most shops that exclusively sell plants are called a nursery regardless of whether they actually start and grow their own plants or purchase them elsewhere. A nursery may sell plants at retail value to the public, or may exist to sell wholesale to other nurseries. In some cases, a plant nursery will specialize in one kind of plant or tree, for example roses, or Japanese maples. This type may still be open to the public a few days of the week, but may primarily do business with other retailers.
